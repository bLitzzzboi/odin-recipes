    <p>Easy recipe for a simple spaghetti squash that goes great with anything!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small spaghetti squash, halved and seeded</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon chopped fresh chervil</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon chopped fresh sage</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon chopped fresh chives</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place spaghetti squash halves cut-sides down in a baking dish and add enough water to come 1/2-inch up the sides of the baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until the squash can easily be pierced with a sharp knife, about 45 minutes. </p>
            <p>Turn squash over, cover with foil again, and continue to cook until the squash is very tender, about 15 more minutes. </p>
            <p>Remove from the oven, uncover, and allow to cool slightly. </p>
            <p>Using a fork, gently pull the strands of squash away from the peel and place into a bowl.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add spaghetti squash strands, chervil, basil, parsley, sage, chives, salt, and pepper and cook until flavors are combined and heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
